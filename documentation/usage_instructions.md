# Usage instructions

## Quick reference / keyboard cheat sheet

- `Arrow keys` + `WASD`: movement
- `Page up` + `Page down`: zoom
- `Left click`: place a tile
- `Ctrl+Z` + `Ctrl+Y`: redo + undo
- `Ctrl+S`: save

## Central menu

After starting the application, the menu at the top-left corner of the screen will be of use.

In the "File" submenu of the aforementioned central menu, the user can select a file to load the tilemap from ("Load a map") or a save the current map to a file ("Save").

In the "Tiles" submenu the user can select a folder from which to load the tiles to be used in constructing the map ("Browse directories"), and select the individual active tile to be used.

The "Minimize" button closes the submenus.

## Creating the map

### Placing tiles

After an active tile has been selected from the "Tiles" submenu, the user can "paint" on the map by holding the left mouse button and dragging the cursor across the screen. This will place tiles in the current map.

### Moving the camera

The user can move around the map by using the arrow keys or the WASD key combination. Zooming can be achieved by using the "Page up" and "Page down" keys.

### Undo & redo

Undoing previous map editing can be done by pressing Ctrl+Z. Similarly, redoing undone actions can be done by pressing Ctrl+Y.

### Quick save

The currently edited map can be saved by pressing Ctrl+S. This will save the map in either the file the current map was loaded from or the file it has most recently been saved to.
If no save/load file has been associated with the current map, the user will be prompted for a save file path.
